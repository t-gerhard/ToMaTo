						Every connection consits of two network interfaces and the connection itself.<br />\
						An interface is represented by a grey circle at a device. Here you can configure the device\'s network preferences (e.g., ip address).<br />\
						The connection is represented by a blue square at its center. Here, you can configure the link (e.g., bandwidth, loss rate, etc).</p>\

						Link emulation does not work when the connection is directly at an external network. Therefore, we need a switch in order to use link emulation.\
					<p class="tutorialExplanation">\
						All devices connected to a switch which is connected to to the internet will have a direct connection to the internet (no NAT router or similar).<br />\
						For this to work, the device must use DHCP. Instead of setting this in the editor, you could also have run "dhclient eth0" on your device.</p>\

						The attributes are devided into two subjects: link emulation and packet capturing.<br />\

					<p class="tutorialExplanation">\
						Values are devided into two columns, one for each direction.<br />\
						Every value only affects packets being sent in that particular direction.<br />\
						The best way to determine the direction of the column is to look at the small graphic. The line has the same orientation as the link has in the editor, and the red arrow is the direction.</p>\
					<p class="tutorialExplanation">\
						Bandwidth and delay should be self-explaining. By setting a jitter, you can simulate a jitter in the delay. You can select how the random jitter is distributed.<br />\
