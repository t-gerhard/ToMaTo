								Let\'s take a closer look at the menu:</p>\
							<p class="tutorialExplanation">\
								It is devided into tabs (Home, Devices, ...). Every tab is devided into multiple Groups (Modes, Topology control, ...), each of which consists of multiple buttons.</p>\
							<p class="tutorialExplanation">\
								Of special importance is the "Modes" group in the "Home" tab: It lets you choose between three modes which define what a left-click in the workspace does when you\'re not using any other features. Especially the "Delete" mode may cause unwanted, irreversible changes to your topology.</p>\
